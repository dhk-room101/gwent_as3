# gwent_as3
this is the original gwent/gwint source code reverse engineered from Witcher 3

all copyrights of course belong to Witcher 3 creators

Its purpose is educational only, it is not compilable/functional out-of-the-box. If you feel adventurous and want to peek under the hood to see how the AI works, for example, this repository should help :-)

the important part of the code can be found here:

I noticed that the first utility I used it to extract the action script code missed some switch statements here and there, so I added code extracted with a different utility, basically use the first version as the master and if something seems to be missing just look at the equivalent from the secondary upload, it should help
