# gwent_as3
this is the original gwent/gwint source code reverse engineered from Witcher 3

Its purpose is educational only, it is not compilable/functional out-of-the-box. If you feel adventurous and want to peek under the hood to see how the AI works, for example, this repository should help :-)

the important part of the code can be found here:
